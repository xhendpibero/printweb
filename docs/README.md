## 🎯 **Quick Start for AI Assistants**

### **1. Read First: [AI Instructions](ai-guidance/ai-instructions.md)**
- Primary rules and guidelines
- Code generation checklist
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Quality standards

### **2. Reference: [Shared Resources](ai-guidance/shared-resources.md)**
- All available types, utils, constants
- Quick lookup to prevent duplication
- Usage examples

### **3. Templates: [Code Templates](ai-guidance/code-templates.md)**
- Ready-to-use code patterns
- Component templates
- Common implementation patterns

### **4. Examples: [Feature Development](examples/feature-development.md)**
- Complete feature implementation examples
- Real-world usage patterns
- Best practices in action

### **5. Refactoring: [Complete Refactoring Checklist](ai-guidance/complete-refactoring-checklist.md)** ✨
- Comprehensive step-by-step refactoring guide
- Quality assurance checklist
- Maintenance guidelines
- Examples of completed refactoring

## 🔧 **How to Use This Documentation**

### **Before Writing Any Code:**
1. ✅ Check [Shared Resources](ai-guidance/shared-resources.md) for existing functionality
2. ✅ Review [AI Instructions](ai-guidance/ai-instructions.md) for rules and patterns
3. ✅ Use [Code Templates](ai-guidance/code-templates.md) for consistent structure
4. ✅ Reference [Examples](examples/feature-development.md) for implementation guidance

### **Decision Tree:**
```
New Code Request
├── Check shared resources first
├── Follow AI instructions
├── Use appropriate templates
└── Reference examples for patterns
```

## 🎨 **Key Principles**

1. **🔄 Reuse First** - Always check shared resources before creating new code
2. **📁 Organize by Feature** - Group related code together
3. **🎯 Single Responsibility** - Each component/function has one clear purpose
4. **🔒 Type Safety** - Use proper TypeScript throughout
5. **📖 Consistency** - Follow established patterns and conventions

## 🚀 **Expected Outcomes**

Following this documentation should result in:
- ✅ **Consistent code structure** across the project
- ✅ **Reduced code duplication** through reuse of shared resources
- ✅ **Maintainable codebase** with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Better AI assistance** with clear context and patterns
- ✅ **Faster development** through established templates and examples

## ✅ **Current Refactoring Status**

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ **Cart Feature** (`src/features/cart/`) - Complete with hooks, utils, and components
- ✅ **Checkout Feature** (`src/features/checkout/`) - All 4 pages refactored (upload, shipment, payment, summary)
- ✅ **Products Feature** (`src/features/products/`) - Product configuration page refactored

**Architecture Achievements:**
- ✅ Feature-based directory structure established
- ✅ Shared resources properly organized (`src/shared/`)
- ✅ Mock data centralized (`src/mocks/`)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created
- ✅ All checkout pages use simplified layout and stepper

## 📝 **Contributing to Documentation**

When adding new shared resources or patterns:
1. Update the relevant documentation files
2. Add examples of usage
3. Include in quick reference guides
4. Maintain consistency with existing patterns
